The Random Timer is a simple program that I created for randomly reminding me of things during the day.

It is kind of like a software version of the [MotivAider](http://habitchange.com).

The application's icon was downloaded from [IconArchive](http://www.iconarchive.com/show/soft-scraps-icons-by-deleket/Clock-icon.html) and was created by [Deleket](http://www.deleket.com).
